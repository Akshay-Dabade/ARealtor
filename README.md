ARealtor stands for, "A Smart Realtor".

## Executive Summary
Buying a home is a big investment and buyers usually spend 15-30 years in that home.
Just as we test drive a car, we believe our consumers should be able to revisit their future homes. It is the ability to see yourself or picture your life and family. ARealtor lets you take a virtual tour of your future home from the comfort of your couch using a laptop, tab, or a mobile device.

##Idea

The product is an addition to the existing homes.com application

When a customer shortlists their favorite houses in the mobile application. 
They can view photos, detailed information about the house, and realtor contact details.
The application does not give you the option to take a virtual tour.
